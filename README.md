CMPUT404 Project SocialDistribution
===================================

# About
The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. Thereâ€™s no really great reason why we should all use facebook or google+ or myspace or something like that. If these social networks came up with an API we could probably link between them and use the social network we wanted. 

Thus in the spirit of [diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) we want to build something like diaspora but far far simpler.

This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of other sources of posts (github, twitter, etc.) as well allow the distributing sharing of posts and content.

For more information about the project description refer to [project orgs](https://github.com/CMPUT-404-Project/Group-Project/blob/main/project.org).

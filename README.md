CMPUT404 Project SocialDistribution
===================================

# About
The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. Thereâ€™s no really great reason why we should all use facebook or google+ or myspace or something like that. If these social networks came up with an API we could probably link between them and use the social network we wanted. Thus in the spirit of [diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) we want to build something like diaspora but far far simpler.

Social Distribution is a distributed social networking web application that allows different users or authors to engage with each other. Users can exist on our local server or on a foreign server - meaning server from a different team who created a similar platform as us. They can interact through follow requests, creating and sharing posts and through liking and commenting on the posts.

Currently the usage is private, please contact the owners if you want to use the app.
